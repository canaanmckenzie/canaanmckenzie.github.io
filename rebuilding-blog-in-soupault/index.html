    <em>Ikigai</em> (ee-key-guy) is a Japanese concept that combines the
terms <em>iki</em>, meaning “alive” or “life,” and <em>gai</em>, meaning
“benefit” or “worth.” This blog is a collection of <em>some</em> of the
things wherein I find worth and wellbeing pursuing happiness and
fulfillment. Caveat being that it is also a space to explore and present
new ideas, projects, successes, and failures. as such, it is a
collection of living documents. A digital garden I tend. Enjoy your
stay.

    The impetus for this post is that I decided to rebuild my blog site
in Soupault. While I’ve used Hugo, Eleventy, Pelican, Jekyll, Hakyll,
and even built (several) blogs from scratch over the years, they
typically end up listless and I have let them fizzle away
unmaintained.

    Recently however I stumbled upon soupault. The user freedom in the
project’s vision drew me to it. I realized I missed that from the
nascent era of the millenial internet where I first began my
denizenship. This blog is going to encompass whatever catches my
interest and I feel is worth writing down. I’m hoping it will be as
minimal as possible while still serving as my portfolio, notebook, and
canvas.
