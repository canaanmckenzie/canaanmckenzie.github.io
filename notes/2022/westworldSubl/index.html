			</div>
			<p>I had been wanting to do this for a while. I often find myself moving from Sublime Theme to Sublime Theme after every few months. I thought it would be nice to write a quick guide if anyone is interested in the same. I've used a fair few IDEs (although I'm not sure Sublime truly falls into this category), but for my current aesthetic and workflow it's been nice and simple.</p>
			<p>As much as Lisp and Vim are familiar, I like the bare bones of working in a nice simple text editor Maybe I'll change in the future, but I've been programming professionally since 2014 and it's held up all this time.</p>
			<p>Anyway, as of yesterday (10/6/2022) I heard that Westworld has been cancelled off its home on HBO. I found the first season of westworld a breath of fresh air, mostly because that's when I was building a 3D printer for tissue engineering while doing research at the University of Vermont. So I thought I would take some time and build out the closest approximation to the IDE that is shown briefly in the show that I can.
			<p class="subtitle">UI Theme and Color Scheme</p>
			<p>The two sections of Sublime necessary to change, these are the code portion and there is the UI which includes the sidebar, tabs, widgets etc.</p>
