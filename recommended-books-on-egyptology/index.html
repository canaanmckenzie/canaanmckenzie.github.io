    My Recommendations on Learning Hieroglyphics
   </h2>
   <p>
    <time id="post-date">2023-10-25</time>
   </p>
   <p>
    Why?
   </p>
   <p>
    Good question.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other than being something interesting, it also presents an
opportunity for some computer vision research, parsing through images of
glyphs and feeding them into what I hope will be something of a
recognition engine for deciphering hieroglyphs. This extends beyond
egyptian, but when I was looking around for a training set, I settled on
this since I have the books and their digital formats readily at
hand.

    <strong>Middle Egyptian</strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Start with middle egyptian, it’s the easiest to learn in the
beginning and the books are easier to parse.

   <p>
    <strong>Late Egyptian</strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    The next stage is late egyptian, I would recommend beginning or at
least having a book on coptic, here is what I use,
   </p>
   <p>
    Lambdin, T.O., 1983. <em>Introduction to Sahidic Coptic</em>. 1st ed.
Macon: Mercer University Press.
   </p>
   <p>
    also pick up an ancient greek dictionary because if a word isn’t
coptic there is a fair chance that it is greek. i personally use.
   </p>
   <p>
    Woodhouse, S. C., <em>English-Greek Dictionary : Vocabulary of the
Attic Language</em>. George Routledge &amp; Sons, Limited. 1910.
   </p>
   <p>
    for the late egyptian itself,
   </p>
   <p>
    Černý, J. &amp; Groll, S., 1993. <em>A Late Egyptian Grammar</em>.
3rd ed. Rome: Biblical Institute Publishing.
   </p>

Egyptian</em>. 2nd ed. Providence: B.C. Scribe Publications.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>Ancient/Classical Egyptian</strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Arguably the hardest part of the language, to be honest these can be
hard to find/read, so I strongly recommend starting from the top and see
how you are doing if you are trying to do this based solely on book
learning and don’t get about a third of the way through and immediately
started building symbolic recognition models to help you do this
computationally like I did.
