    my recommendations on learning hieroglyphics
   </h2>
   <p>
    <time id="post-date">2023-10-25</time>
   </p>
   <p>
    why?
   </p>
   <p>
    good question.
   </p>
   <p>
    other than being something interesting, it also presents an
opportunity for some computer vision research, parsing through images of
glyphs and feeding them into what i hope will be something of a
recognition engine for deciphering hieroglyphs. this extends beyond
egyptian, but when i was looking around for a training set, i settled on
this since i have the books and their digital formats readily at
hand.

    <strong>middle egyptian</strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    start with middle egyptian, it’s the easiest to learn in the
beginning and the books are easier to parse.

   <p>
    <strong>late egyptian</strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    the next stage is late egyptian, i would recommend beginning or at
least having a book on coptic, here is what i use,
   </p>
   <p>
    Lambdin, T.O., 1983. <em>Introduction to Sahidic Coptic</em>. 1st ed.
Macon: Mercer University Press.
   </p>
   <p>
    also pick up an ancient greek dictionary because if a word isn’t
coptic there is a fair chance that it is greek. i personally use.

Attic Language</em>. George Routledge &amp; Sons, Limited. 1910.

   <p>
    for the late egyptian itself,

   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>ancient/classical egyptian</strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    arguably the hardest part of the language, to be honest these can be
hard to find/read, so i strongly recommend starting from the top and see
how you are doing if you are trying to do this based solely on book
learning and don’t get about a third of the way through and immediately
started building symbolic recognition models to help you do this
computationally like I did.
