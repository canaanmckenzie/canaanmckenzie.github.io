        <!--<p>A brief introduction to basic information theory (entropy/information as a measure for theoretical unpredictability of data) and descriptive statistics (central tendency, dispersion, and shape). The maximilization of entropy under different constraints yields some common probability distributions: uniform distribution (given no prior knowledge); normal distribution (given that mean and variance are known)....-->
